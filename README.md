# SMU-CSE2341-Text-File-Binary-Search-Sort
This is a project that was assigned to me during my Data Structures Class.


<b><h3>Purpose of the Project:</h3></b>

To build a program in C++ that reads in a .txt file containing an unknown quantity of words with each word seperated by a newline.

The program uses a custom Binary Search algorithm and a custom alphabetical sort algorithm in order to find the appropriate words.

The program writes the sorted words to an output.txt file and lists them in order of length first, then alphabetically.

<b><h3>Data Structures Used</h3></b>

I used my custom String and Vector class for this project.

<b>If any Custom Data Structures are not included, they are all in my "My Custom Data Structures" repo.</b>


<b><h3>Instructions</h3></b>

In order to properly gain results, the specified .txt file must be passed through the command line as the first arg.

The .txt files syntax is very particular, each word must be on its own line as I used the newline character to delimit.

Finally, to see the results, the output.txt file must also be the second arg.


<b>Example input.txt and output.txt files have been included!</b>
